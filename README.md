# React Router v6 Nested Routes Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when working with nested routes in React Router v6.  The problem involves nested routes failing to render correctly, even when the routes appear to be correctly defined.  The solution provided addresses this by carefully examining the route structure and ensuring proper nesting and path definitions.

## Problem

The original `bug.js` file contains a React Router v6 setup with nested routes. Despite the routes being defined, they do not render as expected.  This often manifests as only the parent route rendering, while the child routes remain inaccessible.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version. The fix might involve adjustments to the path definitions, component structure, or the way the routes are nested within the parent route.
